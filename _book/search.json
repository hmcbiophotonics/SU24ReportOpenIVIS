    "text": "3.4 References in Quarto\nIn Quarto, you can manage references using BibTeX. To do so, you should create a reference.bib file in the root directory of your project. This file will contain BibTeX entries for your citations.\nFor example, this project contains an example references.bib file containing a single reference.\n@article{goodman1976some,\n  title={Some fundamental properties of speckle},\n  author={Goodman, Joseph W},\n  journal={JOSA},\n  volume={66},\n  number={11},\n  pages={1145--1150},\n  year={1976},\n  publisher={Optica Publishing Group}\n}\nTo link the references file we need to include two new entries in the _quarto.yml file.\nbibliography: references.bib\ncsl: ieee.csl\nThese lines tell Quarto where to find the .bib file and what citation style to use (controlled by the citation style with a .csl file). In this project we use an IEEE style.\nTo cite the reference in the main text, type the @ symbol followed by the citekey. In this case, that would be @goodman1976some.\nHere is an example.\n\nThe probability distribution of a linearly polarized, fully-developed speckle pattern follows a negative exponential distribution [1].\n\nWhen Quarto renders the document, it will place a citation in place of the @citekey pattern and automatically include a linked footnote and a list of references at the bottom.\n\n\n\n\n[1] J.

In your case, you’ll likely skip this step since you’ll likely have a dataset from elsewhere to use.\nFirst, let’s create a Python code block to create some random data.\n\nimport numpy as np\n\nN = 100 # Set number of data points\n\nx = np.linspace(0, 10, N) # Create x vector\ny = 5*x + np.random.rand(N)      # Generate linear data with simulated noise\n\nNext, let’s save this data in our /data/ subfolder. You can choose various formats, but one convenient option is to save the data in a .mat file. This way it can be opened and processed in Matlab as well as Python. It also allows you to nicely structure the data and will make the loading and plotting code we develop Matlab compatible.\n\nimport scipy.io as sio  # Load Scipy IO module which has the function to save and load .mat files\n\ndata_to_save = {'x': x, 'y': y} # Create dictionary to story the data\nsio.savemat('data/test_data.mat', data_to_save)  # Save the data to a .mat file\n\n\n\n5.4.2 Load and Plot Data\nFirst let’s load the data from the .mat file.\n\ndata_load = sio.loadmat('data/test_data.mat')\n\nThen, let’s plot it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nNote carefully that because of how savemat() works, we need to index into the zeroth element of the dictionary values in order to get to the data we want.\n\n\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\n\nax.plot(data_load['x'][0],data_load['y'][0]) # Note that we are using the loaded data here and watch out for indexing.\nax.set_xlabel('x [units]')\nax.set_ylabel('y [units]')\nax.set_title('Plot of Random Data')\n\nText(0.5, 1.0, 'Plot of Random Data')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4.3 Save and Plot Images of Figures\nWe can even go ahead and save the plots as images if we want to have the flexiblity to include them elsewhere.\n\nfig.savefig('images/test_data_plot.png', dpi=300)\n\nThen we can directly display as a Quarto figure as usual.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.1: Displaying image of plotted random example data.",
