The introduction should contain background information to help a reader understand the context for the work that will be presented in the remaining sections of the report.
Typically, an introduction contains a number of references to prior work to help the reader understand the relevant literature that the project is building upon.

## References in Quarto
In Quarto, you can manage references using BibTeX.
To do so, you should create a `reference.bib` file in the root directory of your project.
This file will contain BibTeX entries for your citations.

For example, this project contains an example [`references.bib`](../../references.bib) file containing a single reference.

```{tex}
@article{goodman1976some,
  title={Some fundamental properties of speckle},
  author={Goodman, Joseph W},
  journal={JOSA},
  volume={66},
  number={11},
  pages={1145--1150},
  year={1976},
  publisher={Optica Publishing Group}
}
```

To link the references file we need to include two new entries in the [`_quarto.yml`](../../_quarto.yml) file.

```{yml}
bibliography: references.bib
csl: ieee.csl
```

These lines tell Quarto where to find the `.bib` file and what citation style to use (controlled by the citation style with a `.csl` file).
In this project we use an IEEE style.

To cite the reference in the main text, type the `@` symbol followed by the `citekey`. 
In this case, that would be `@goodman1976some`.

Here is an example.

> The probability distribution of a linearly polarized, fully-developed speckle pattern follows a negative exponential distribution @goodman1976some.

When Quarto renders the document, it will place a citation in place of the `@citekey` pattern and automatically include a linked footnote and a list of references at the bottom.
